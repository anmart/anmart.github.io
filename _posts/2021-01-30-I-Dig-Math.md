## Digmine Quickfast
In August of 2014 I participated in [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com) number 30. This was my first gamejam and the results were... not amazing. I hadn't made a game in several years, and I had definitely not tried to make one within a weekend. In the end, the project only barely fit the theme, and definitely wasn't going to win any awards, but it was playable and I was happy with it. 

This game was called **DigMine QuickFast**. It was extremely inspired by games such as Motherload, Utopian Mining, and SteamWorld Dig, but lacked a lot of the progression that made those games so great. I managed to get just enough of the mechanics finished, but not a lot of content.

## I Dig Math
When school started, I showed this project to my Game Art and Design teacher. He told me about his wife's 5th grade classroom, and the topics they were learning that year. We brainstormed ways to re-envision my project as an educational game that her children could play in the classroom to learn and have fun at the same time. 

One topic her students were working on were how the powers of 10 worked. We thought about it and came up with the idea to replace ores with digits, and add x10 and x1/10 multipliers. A prompt would appear at the top and you would have to fill out the digits one by one to finish out a combo and earn money to purchase useful upgrades like more powerful drills or faster flying. Later in its life, the game also gained a teacher mode, where teachers could enter very specific prompts that all students would have a chance to enter within their own games.

After a few weeks of working, I had a demo and some rough drafts for ideas on where to go next. I decided to enter it into the Technology Student Association gamedev competition. I worked with a few other people who contributed music, a few art assets, and lots of help with design and ideas. We ended up winning 1st in the State-wide competition, and top 10 in the National competition. A version of I Dig Math was used in my teacher's wife's classroom for several years.

## I Dig Math (Unity Edition)
After I graduated from high school, I brought up the idea of working on I Dig Math again to some of the people that helped make the original version a reality. I organized bimonthly meetings where I would record notes, assign tasks, and bring everyone up to date on what was accomplished during the previous two weeks. 

Rather than working on the original version of I Dig Math, we decided to remake it entirely in the popular game engine Unity. This would allow for easy compilation for multiple platforms, including web. It didn't take too long to get the basics in, but unfortunately everyone in the group was extremely busy with college, and work eventually fluttered out.

A link to the demo for the Unity version of the game can be found [here](/IDM/index.html). You can also download the windows versions of the original [I Dig Math](/IDM/IDMClassic.zip) or of the [Unity version](/IDM/IDM.zip).
