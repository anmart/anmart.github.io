Hello! My Name is Andrew Martinek. I am a 4th year Computer Science student, interested in Game and Software Development, Reverse Engineering, and general computer wizardry.

This site is currently being worked on. In the future, it will have writeups about my <a href="https://github.com/anmart">github projects,</a> my personal game projects, and possibly some of my RE and CTF efforts.
